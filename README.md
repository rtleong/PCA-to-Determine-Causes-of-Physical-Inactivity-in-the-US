## Considerations
This was one of my first self-guided projects involving *most* of the DS lifecycle, including Data Cleaning, EDA, ML (PCA), and testing. The strategies implemented are not the most efficient, and the coding style is not the cleanest, but this projects served as a valuable learning experience to develop the skill of writing clean and readable programs, and considering all types of algorithms and models to implement.
